Volumme Types  :

/dev/hda    ---  IDE/PATA
/dev/sda    ---  SATA/SCSI
/dev/xvda   ---  Virtual disks     ---->  /dev/xvda1   -- First Partition
					  /dev/xvda2   -- Second Partition
/dev/xvdb   ---  

df -h   ---- to check all mount points

fdisk -l   ---  To check how many volumes are attached
fdisk /dev/xvdf   ---- make sure that give right disk name
m   for help
n  -- to add new partition
p  -- to partion type
1 or just enter  --  to select parition number
just enter from start and end sector
+3G or +2G or what ever size you want here.
w  --   write all changes to here

Now check for new disk

fdisk -l

Now we have to create file system here i can format it using below command to check file system

mkfs   --- type this and check diff types file systems are available and in linux always go wwith ext4
file -s /dev/xvdf1  --- to check for file system
mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf1

we are going to mount it now

mkdir /opt/datadir
mount /dev/xvdf1 /opt/datadir/
df -h  -- to check for all mount points.
cd /opt/datadir
ls
data+lost   should br found if it is new 

It is called temporary mount point if you reboot this system this mount can be gone

How to create permanant mount

cat /etc/fstab

/dev/xvdf1	/opt/datadir	ext4	defaults	0 0

:wq
now run command below one
If you want to unmount current one
umount /dev/xvdf1 /opt/datadir
df -h    --- it has to be removed
mount -a

cd /opt/datadir
create some files and folders
touch file1 file2 file3
mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3
ls 
file1 file2 file2 dir1 dir2 dir3

cd

now unmount your volume
umount /dev/xvdf1 /opt/datadir

cd /opt/datadir
ls
nothing wil be available

cd
mount -a
cd /opt/datadir
ls 
file1 file2 file2 dir1 dir2 dir3

so always root volume can not have your data it is available for os related data
so if we need any kind of data we have to create our own volume
df -h

cd /opt/datadir
umount /opt/datadir - It cant be un mount since we are in same location so it is busy
that time if we want to know about the running process
lsof /opt/datadir   - It can show us what are the processes are currently running so we can kill them 
                      using below command   --- kill -9 processid
fuser /opt/datadir  - This also show same output like about running processes

This is the better way to unmount rather than doing force unmount


step1. List the Partitions/Volumes using command    ----->  lsblk
step2. we checked in if there is any file system on the volume/Partition  ---->  file -s /dev/xvdf
step3. We created a new file system on the new Volume/Partition (only if it is empty) ----> mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf      ---> t - type of file system (ext4)
step4. Traverse back to the root directory/folder and then create a new directory  ----> mkdir /fileserver
step5. Mounted the new Volume/Partition to the fileserver directory  ----> mount /dev/xvdf /fileserver
        --- > If you use this command to mount it will unmount when you reboot your system   --- Temporary Mount
        ----> For Permanant Mount point  and we should always permanant mount using below file and run some command  'mount -a'

              There is a file called ---- cat /etc/fstab
                                          vi /etc/fstab
                                          /dev/xvdf1	/fileserver	ext4	0 0       -----   0 0 dump code and fsc code of file system to check cod, 
                                                                                                  0 means when we reboot it will not file systemand and dont take any dump when crash it

              mount -a 
step6. check into fileserver directory/folder and see thet files are available    --- >   cd fileserver ------>  ls -lrt
step7. Only one file Lost+found was available and we can create our file now any two using vi editor or nano editor commands
step8. Once created recheck the directory/folder usinng 'ls' command 
step9. Traverse back to the root directory/folder then unmount the Volume/Partition	---->  umount /dev/xvdf    ---> umonut /dev/xvdf -l   ---->  -l means lazy mount or we can unmount forcefully but dont go alwasy with this option

        or other use case we can do here 
	- Just go to our create file system     cd /fileserver
	- and delete everything 		rm -rf *    (before this we have to create snapshot this is important)
	- and then unmount disk			umount /dev/xvdf
	- Then we can detach from volumes sections from our instance.
	- Then we have to assign new volume which was created  by snapshot
step10. Now we created snapshot of this volume.

Volumes Use cases  :

1. Backup & Restore
2. Change Volume type   ---> You can change the volume type form magnatic or SSD
3. Change Zone
4. Change size          ---> You can change the size of EBS (Elastic Block Storage) volumne ( Increase or Decrease )
